Prigovor is a mini-blog project that implements basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing posts. It uses React for building the user interface and is integrated with Firebase services to handle data storage and user authentication.

Key features of the project include:

User Authentication: Firebase Authentication is used to authenticate users, allowing them to register, log in, and manage their sessions securely.

Database Integration: Firebase Realtime Database is utilized to store and retrieve blog posts, providing a real-time, cloud-based backend solution.

Routing: React Router is employed to navigate between different pages (such as login, register, home, and post details), enabling a single-page application (SPA) experience.

State Management: Redux is integrated to manage the global state of the application, ensuring consistent and predictable state across components.

React Native Hooks: React Native Hooks are used to handle state and lifecycle methods within functional components, improving the efficiency and readability of the code.
